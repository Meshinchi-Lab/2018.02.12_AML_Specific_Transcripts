# Analysis Directory 
### for 2018.02.12_AML_Specific_Transcripts

The following scripts are those that generated the Non-hematopoietic Genes Analysis (in collaboration with Ben Huang). The outputs have been shared on the dropbox directory `AML_Restricted_Genes`. 

* TARGET_AML_1031_AML_Specific_Tx_Function_01.14.22.Rmd
* TARGET_AML_1031_AML_Specific_Tx_Function_Visualization_02.16.2022.Rmd 

The `TARGET_AML_1031_AML_Specific_Tx_Function_Visualization_02.16.2022.Rmd` script also contains the gene ranking analysis. 

The script `TARGET_AML_Restricted_Genes_in_Fusions_RBD_Kallisto_DEGs.Rmd` defined the differential expression analysis for each of the AML fusion subtypes included in the Non-hematopoietic Genes Analysis, and can be used for volcano plots to visualize the level of overexpression for targets identified using expression thresholds. The `TARGET_AML_KMT2A_Specific_Genes_09.20.21.Rmd` was completed specifically to look for genes uniquely expressed in KMT2A cohorts.
